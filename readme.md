# CineMMA App

CineMMA App, the right place to see all about your favorite movies around the world.

*Architecture*

My decisions of the architecture were easy because MVVM is the most popular code architecture, it helps you to fix bugs and issues in a easier way, you can test the app faster. If any developer that knows this pattern can easily modify and add more funcionallity to the app.

## Installation

clone or Download this repository to have the Android studio project and just let the project synchronies and index all the components. It will be easy to run the project and see the work that I have done.


## Libraries

**Retrofit2 and GSON**
	Retrofit2 its to make the call to the Web Service and GSON Converter to cast the response of the Webservices and use that movie object.

  Kotlin Coroutines to implement the long process of the retrofit call.
   
  ViewModel and LiveData to bind the data from the view modal to the View

  Kodein Dependency Injection to bind the classes that I used.

  Android Room Local databaseto store the movies.

  Android Navigation Architecture to create the graph that allows me to set the views on the graph.
  
  Groupie data binding RecyclerView, you can implement a quick recyclerView with this library.

  SharedPreferences Kotlin because it changed the version of the latest 29 api.

  Glide to show the picture on the adapter of the list movie poster
